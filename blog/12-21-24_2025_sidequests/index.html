        <h2 id="resolutions-are-stupid">resolutions are stupid</h2>
        <p>they are. so often people make new years resolutions as empty
        promises they’ll never fulfil. im not gonna make any promises to myself
        or anyone else, but i have seriously high hopes for this year. in the
        past year i have grown a ton as a person and i think 2025 is my year to
        come out of the chrysalis and be a new me. instead of resolutions ive
        given myself a few sidequests. they don’t necessarily have an end, at
        least not one that i can see yet, but i want to embark on these journeys
        this year.</p>
        <h2 id="new-year-new-me">00: new year new me</h2>
        <p>nobody can just decide to be a new person because there’s a new year.
        trying to skip the process is a great way to not make any progress. if
        you want to be a new, better person, at some point you have to step back
        to <a href="https://youtu.be/TO99fEiI5Hk?t=1258" target="_blank">square one</a>.</p>
        <p>this year i want to put significant effort into letting go of the
        things that hold me back and be a happier, healthier person who can live
        life fuller. i have a lot of trauma to unpack and a lot of my developed
        instincts like fear responses and defense mechanisms that end up hurting
        me and others more than they help. it wont be easy and it wont be quick
        but i want to wholeheartedly commit myself to my improvement.</p>
        <p>when i say “this is my year” i dont expect it to be perfect. it’s
        probably gonna be pretty shit in all honesty. but this is my year to
        grow. this is my year to catch up to my potential. im gonna try to stop
        being so scared all the time, im gonna try to trust people better, im
        gonna try so damn hard to escape the box that my past has me stuck in.
        2025 is <em>my</em> year.</p>
        <h2 id="stop-being-scared-of-daws">01: stop being scared of DAWs</h2>
        <p>much less serious and emotional, simply i want to stop being scared
        of DAWs. i love music and i love making it but anytime i’ve tried to i
        get scared by how daunting the software looks, it makes it really hard
        to know where to start, and this year i want to try. it’s not gonna be
        good music but by the end of the year i want to make music.</p>
        <h2 id="commit-to-learning-toki-pona">02: commit to learning toki
        pona</h2>
        <p>i’ve had my eye on <a href="https://tokipona.org/" target="_blank">toki pona</a> - a
        conlang with only 120-140 words in it - for a few years now. i’ve talked
        about wanting to learn it but never committed, and this year i want to.
        i won’t by any means reach fluency of any sorts but i want to at least
        take the first step. i already know two whole words: pan (bread) and
        unpa (sex), sounds like a great start.</p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>
        <p>resolutions are stupid. a trendy set of empty promises that all too
        many people give up on. these are my sidequests for 2025, and im hoping
        i can at least get a good start on them. in that time i’ll be working
        and studying, a year from today i’ll be graduated from college and
        hopefully entering the workforce. here’s to <a
