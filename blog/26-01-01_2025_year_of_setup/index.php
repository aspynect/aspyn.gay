        <blockquote>
        <p>> when i say “this is my year” i dont expect it to be perfect. it’s
        probably gonna be pretty shit in all honesty. but this is my year to
        grow.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>at the start of 2025 year, i said this was my year, and that you
        can’t skip the process, and this year sure was full of process. overall?
        pretty shit year if you look at the small picture, but i’ve never felt
        this set up to have an amazing year going into 2026.</p>
        <h2 id="recap">01: recap</h2>
        <h3 id="bugmush">bugmush</h3>
        <p>on january 6th i joined <a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/bugmu.sh">bugmush</a>, mainly to hang out
        with my friends but it also was going to help me with my <a target="_blank"
        href="https://aspyn.gay/blog/24-12-21_2025_sidequests/">sidquest</a> to
        stop being scared of the DAW. while i didnt make nearly as much progress
        in this department, it helpedme feel out what i want to get out of music
        and what fulfillment i like to see from it. turns out? production isn’t
        really for me. but i loveee writing and vocals, and that is something i
        want to pursue further.</p>
        <p>beyond that, this is where i met so many amazing friends this year,
        as well as a particularly special someone i’ll talk about more later</p>
        <h3 id="chicago">chicago</h3>
        <p>in february, i spontaneously flew over to chicago to spend two days
        with my then-girlfriend and <a target="_blank"
        href="https://bsky.app/profile/cinny.umm.gay">my wife</a>, along with a
        metamour. while it was a nice weekend, i do not recommend sleeping 4
        people to a bed.</p>
        <p>in march, i then went back, this time driving with my college friend
        <a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/kennecfox.bsky.social">kenji</a> to
        see saoirse dream, fraxiom, and leastfavorite! perform live. while there
        i got to meet more of my friends i’d met in bugmush. it was the first
        show i’ve ever been to, and it was so incredible, and it made me want
        more. again an amazing day, but i also do not recommend daytripping a 6
        hour drive each way on a school night.</p>
        <h3 id="iowa-moment">iowa moment</h3>
        <p>i, along with some friends, went to protest a bill at the iowa
        capitol that threatened to remove gender identity as a protected group
        under the state civil rights code. there was so much turnout but
        unfortunately nothing could stop that hellish state’s legislation along
        side kim reynolds (fuck kim reynolds) from doing the evils that they
        were determined to do. i do not recommend losing your civil rights on a
        thursday afternoon— this accelerated my graduation plan greatly.</p>
        <h3 id="england-pt.1">england (pt.1)</h3>
        <p>also in march, i flew out during my spring break to see my wife in
        england. this week was incredible— i fell in love with tesco mac &amp;
        cheese and greggs sausage rolls. it was a hard week but was amazing. i
        do not recommend having 6 people staying in a 2 bed apartment even for
        just a week.</p>
        <h3 id="food-house-pt.1">food house (pt.1)</h3>
        <p>in may i went to food house shows in minneapolis and milwaukee, and
        had a blast both times. i bought a cd at the first show and had them
        sign it, and then shocked them by showing up at the next show the next
        night. i don’t recommend physically exerting yourself to your limit two
        nights in a row, but sometimes the fun is worth it. live your happiest
        life.</p>
        <h3 id="graduation">graduation</h3>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://aspyn.gay/blog/25-05-18_graduation/">i
        graduated</a>. i don’t recommend spending hundreds of thousands on a
        piece of paper that may not help you in any way</p>
        <h3 id="stray-kids">stray kids</h3>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://aspyn.gay/blog/25-05-26_skzseattle/">i went to a
        stray kids concert</a>. i don’t recommend standing all day in the hot
        sun for a chance at good seats, but it’s worth it once right?</p>
        <h3 id="gdq">gdq</h3>
        <p>sgdq 2025… happened. im going to glaze over this for many reasons
        good and bad.</p>
        <h3 id="england-pt.-2">england (pt. 2)</h3>
        <p>in august, i booked a one way ticket to england with the intention of
        coming back Sometime. i had some plans but not a whole lot of them, i
        was just taking my time and living happiness. this would end up being a
        3 month trip that would be so fun, so overwhelming, and would enlighten
        me to a lot of things that have made me feel much more prepared for the
        future.</p>
        <p>i met a lot of wonderful people while i was there, some of the first
        being cinny’s parents. who. we are not entirely sure if they know she’s
        poly. but i did accidentally meow in front of them within 10 minutes of
        them being there. and they did think it was yoru (hana’s cat).</p>
        <p>but, within the first week or so of me being there, the food house
        show we’d planned months prior happened. that night was amazing in a way
        i never could have predicted and that i could never forget. there, i met
        síoda irl for the first time. i had fully prepared myself to stand at
        the back of the show and enjoy the music like i usually did at shows
        like this, but she grabbed me by the hand and dragged me out into the
        crowd. singing and dancing with her that night was maybe the most ive
        ever let myself feel alive in a moment, and the rest of the weekend was
        more amazing than i ever could have planned for.</p>
        <p>i’ve learned over the years that my personality disorder is to be
        taken seriously so i was soooo patient and normal . but i <em>did</em>
        have her back over a month later. for one of the first times ever i went
        on a real date, and after a whole evening of being too shy to ask her
        out, i finally did it. i could talk about her forever, so i won’t get
        going too far, but i love her and she has been so wonderful for me in a
        way that i couldn’t even begin to explain.</p>
        <p>…then i had her over a third time when we went to the saoirse
        dream/canofbliss/russelbuck show with cinny and eden. oh my goodness
        that was wonderful, it is so fun to sing and dance with people you
        love.</p>
        <p>i also got to see my best friend! two whole different times while i
        was there! that was so amazing and so cool and it was amazing and epic
        and its so cool.</p>
        <p>i got to go see a bunch of oomfs while i was there…. too much to talk
        about here. but it was epic</p>
        <p>incidentally at the same time some Events that are too much to talk
        about publicly led to me talking again with some friends that i hadn’t
        talked to in a while.</p>
        <p>i got to reconnect with my wonderful friend tau, who i even got to go
        visit before i left the country. we hung out and started watching dragon
        ball and went to its fgc locals. my train back to sheffield got
        cancelled :D so i had to stay an extra night . oh noooo</p>
        <p>but also i got to reconnect with nero, someone who i was very close
        to a couple years ago but were kept apart due to Reasons :tm:, and it
        was incredible to get to talk again under circumstances that we could
        actually be open and ourselves. i fell in love with them a second time,
        and a few days after getting home, at the start of december, we started
        dating.</p>
        <h3 id="the-end-of-the-year">the end of the year</h3>
        <p>just last night, i went up to the cities and spent new years with my
        lovely friend autumn and its local friends. i spent a lot of time
        thinking and reflecting on the year, which led me to this post.</p>
        <h2 id="now">02: now</h2>
        <p>right now, i feel like i’ve set myself up for the best position i’ve
        ever been in. i have three amazing partners who i love so dearly, an
        amazing support system of friends who have my back, i’m starting a part
        time job soon, and overall i’m looking forward to this year and the
        future as a whole in a way i never have before.</p>
        <h2 id="the-new-year">03: the new year</h2>
        <p>as we know, i hate resolutions. resolutions tend to be peoples’
        shallow goals that they think they can just Do and keep with a bit of
        determination. this year i’m reprising everyone’s favorite: we got
        sidequests baybeeeeeeee</p>
        <h2 id="a-love-right">03a: love right</h2>
        <p>i have so much love in my life right now, and this year i want to
        love with my whole heart. no compromises, no fear, and no reservations.
        im going to see my partners this year and even when they’re far away im
        going to do everything i can to overcome my fears and love like i never
        have before.</p>
        <h2 id="b-reclaim-music">03b: reclaim music</h2>
        <p>in the past couple years, because of some people who fundamentally
        shaped my music taste turning out to be quite terrible people, listening
        to music has become significantly harder and it has not had its same
        place in my day to day life that it used to. i want to reclaim this and
        start listening to music more, and i want to be able to love it like i
        used to.</p>
        <h2 id="c-make-more-music">03c: make more music</h2>
        <p>i’ve written and recorded on little practice beats friends have made,
        and i’ve made a MYOM song, and i want to do this more. i want to
        practice and get better and get to the point that maybe i can have more
        confidence in doing collaborations.</p>
        <h2 id="d-finish-dragon-ball">03d: finish dragon ball</h2>
        <p>admittedly, tau and i committed to watch all of dragon ball before we
        realized how big of a committment it was. irregardless we have
        committed, and i’ve downloaded the Seed of Might color corrections of
        the OG series and the db/dbz movies. we’re hoping to finish it this
        year, and it’s exciting.</p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>
        <p>last year set me up real good to have the best year ever this year.
        im gonna make the most of it.</p>
