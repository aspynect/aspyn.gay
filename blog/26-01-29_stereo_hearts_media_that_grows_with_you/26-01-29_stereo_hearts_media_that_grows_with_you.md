## 00: my heart's a stereo
when The Papercut Chronicles Part II by Gym Class Heroes came out, i was just 6 years old. naturally at this age, i was capable of listening to music on the radio but there wasn't much thought about it beyond the raw entertainment i enjoyed from listening to music

when [stereo hearts](https://youtu.be/T3E9Wjbq44E) shuffled on over the speakers at work today, i saw the song in a way i hadn't before, and it prompted metathought about the appreciation and interpretation of media and how it changes as you grow older and experience more things

naturally as a 6 year old, this song was just one of many pop love songs that would eventually worm its way into my nostalgia bank. *vaguely gestures at adam levine* aside, it's a nice song and i can see how its catchy writing had my attention when i was a kid. it wasn't particularly special and didn't have many life experiences or character to hit close to.

## 01: it beats for you
in my teen years, i still enjoyed this song as i do with most of the songs from the radio when i was a kid. but as i gained experiene with life and developed the ability to think and feel for myself, the themes started to really catch on. my heart is a stereo and it beats for *you*. to hear one's thoughts in every note is a tale of devotion and romantic integration, where your love for someone intertwines itself with your every day life. things feel and sound like them, your thoughts relate to them, and you want to share everything with them.

while not the most deep of thoughts, "turn me up when you feel low" evokes the drive to be there for someone you love when they're in need, and to make sure they know you're reliable and have their back. this is what love started to feel like as i was experiencing it in my teen years. 

## 02: last girl left a couple cracks // purchase mad d batteries
but, what really clicked today, despite being something i had thought about before, was Travie McCoy's second verse on the song. it's rich with feelings about things that i truly only think i can understand now, because until recently it wasn't really a relatable feeling; he describes in abstract being an imperfect lover and a broken person hoping in your heart that you can still be loved despite your flaws (if i was a dusty record / i apologize for any skipping tracks / last girl that played me left a couple cracks). 

as someone who has, in short, been through some shit in my life, i'm no stranger to feeling broken, unlovable, and alone. but to be truly loved is to be seen and understood for your flaws, and loved not just despite of them, but in accomodation to them. a really strong relationship isn't just about what you like about each other, it's about how you cover each others' weaknesses and draw out all of each others' strengths, pushing each other to be your best selves. to love and devote yourself to someone who trusts you as much as you trust them and has your back when you need them is magical in the same way as it is to treasure something even if it's old and broken. 

## 03: sing along to my stereo
this post isn't about the song, despite it being in the title. it's a reflection on the way that your interpretation of the media around you can grow alongside you and it isn't cemented on your first impression. it's beautiful how the same thing can mean different but equally important things to different people, but even over time shift in meaning and grow deeper and wiser as you do alongside it. growing and changing is a beautiful part of life that is so complex and fascinating, and being able to get more and more out of the things you've had by your side the whole time is comforting in a uniquely amazing way. listen to your favorite music, watch your favorite movies and otherwise consume your favorite art, and think about what it makes you feel and why. maybe the next time you put thought to it, you won't have the same conclusions as you've become more than you once were.
