        <p>this weekend i got to see stray kids while visiting a friend in
        seattle!!! ive been wanting to do this for years, im so happy i finally
        got to</p>
        <h2 id="seattle">00: seattle</h2>
        <p>my first day in we did some tourism before we got in to the hotel. we
        went to the seattle aquarium, which was very cool but i also discovered
        i can get motion sick!! shoutouts to concave glass, very disorienting.
        we also went on the ferris wheel on the pier which was really cool, this
        place is beautiful and it was an amazing view. we got 5 rounds on the
        wheel even though it said we would get 3. we then whent on “wings of
        washington” which was a cool “4d” experience showing off a lot of
        scenery in the state. this wasnt the greatest idea given the
        aforementioned motion sickness but it was very fun.</p>
        <h2 id="the-hotel">01: the hotel</h2>
        <p>this shit is crazy. first off its expensive enough that im not being
        allowed to know how much it is so uh. shoutouts my friend’s mom ! but
        its very nice, right next to the stadium, we can even peek in through
        the sides of it from our room. the best part though is that the rooftop
        pool has a view that we can peek into the stadium, and all day today
        (friday) the boys were rehearsing and we had a little party of people on
        the roof watching, it was like a cute pre-concert. we didnt manage to
        get our merch today bc the line was like 4 hours long but we’ll get our
        stuff tomorrow :D im gonna be swagged out in my shit tomorrow. im hoping
        the losers that have been camping the past couple days dont get anything
        for actively going against what we were told but. idk lol</p>
        <h2 id="concert-day">02: concert day!!</h2>
        <p>oh my god im just getting back to this a couple days later and it was
        so miserable leading up. up at 4am, standing for hours until 8am when
        the line started, but we got incredibly lucky being at the right place
        at the right time, being near the line when it started. after another 2
        hours the line started moving. took another hour or so to get our bands,
        and i ended up being #143 in pit 3, which was a lot better than we were
        expecting. we made some friends in the line around us that were super
        cool, and later around 3:30 we met up with them again for the line into
        the stadium. when we got in, we barely made it to the barricade just
        barely, i was the last person to get a barricade spot. i cannot
        overstate how long we spent standing between the different lines, but we
        made it to soundcheck!!! it was super cool. bangchan finished my finger
        heart during, it was super cute. later during the concert han waved at
        me and finished my heart, and towards the end hyunjin (my bias) stood on
        the step right in front of me, genuinely inches away. it was super cool
        hearing the unit songs and some of the newer songs i hadnt heard before
        for the first time, and they played topline too!!! thats my favorite
        song of theirs :D towards the end when they played the <a
        href="https://youtu.be/KPUz3Iq_KbA">video project</a> and brought out
        the <a
        href="https://x.com/Stray_Kids/status/1926526602952769989">banners</a>
        that my friends worked on, it was super cute and it made me feel really
        happy for the community. after the concert we met up with friends and
        got to bed, beyond exhausted. when the concert adrenaline wore out i was
        incapable of standing on my feet, we crashed so hard lmao</p>
        <h2 id="cupsleeve">03: cupsleeve</h2>
        <p>the morning after, we thankfully got some good rest and my body wasnt
        completely destroyed. i went to the cupsleeve event my friends were
        hosting, and it was wonderful. so many cool people handing out freebies
        still, and the other vendors were great. i also got a cute hat :D im not
        really one for hats but i like it a lot. made it to the airport that
        afternoon and said my goodbyes, it was hard but i know ill be back
        soon.</p>
        <h2 id="retrospect">04: retrospect</h2>
        <p>was it worth it? i think so. am i doing it again? absolutely not. we
        got so lucky to be able to get a good spot and if we hadn’t it would
        have not been worth, if i ever come back to see them it’ll be seated. i
        had a blast though, i got to spend good time with a close riend i dont
        see often, and i got to meet a ton of cool new people. gonna go down in
        my list some of the best weekends ive ever had</p>
