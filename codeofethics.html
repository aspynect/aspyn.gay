        <h1>personal code of ethics</h1>

        <h2>pre-preamble</h2>
        <p>i made this for an assignment in college at 19 while incredibly sleep deprived in approximately 20 minutes, vaguely inspired by the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/codeofethics.html", target="_blank">sqlite code of ethics</a>. despite the circumstance, i stand by these tenets and strive to abide by them for the sake of my own livelihood and wellbeing</p>

        <h2>Preamble: Introduction and Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Ethics are an incredibly important part of life, and I personally believe that ethical behavior is, at its core, a basic expression of kindness and love for the people, life, and world around us. Technology in particular is an ethically tumultuous field, in which those on the bleeding edge of innovation often will fail ethically or open the doors for others to do so, and as such it is important to establish a code of ethics to ensure one can do their part and contribute to the advancement of computer science in a manner that is to the benefit of the people and not at their expense. The following Rule is a set of obligations that I strive to follow to the best of my ability both in my work and in my daily life to live morally with respect to oneself, one’s peers, the life and nature in one’s surroundings, the establishments one lives under, and the world in which one occupies.</p>

        <h2>The Rule</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>The Self
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Appreciate yourself and your work; you are valuable.</li>
                    <li>Care for yourself; you only get one body, only one life. Take care of it.</li>
                    <li>Treat yourself; you’re doing great, reap your reward.</li>
                    <li>Hold your own accountability; learn and grow, make your failures right.</li>
                    <li>Engage with the pain as a motive; awareness of your condition allows escape.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The Peers
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Treat others as you would treat yourself; share the tenets of The Self.</li>
                    <li>Love unconditionally; love for love, not for gain, for it knows no bounds.</li>
                    <li>Listen to those who are different; perspective is a blessing.</li>
                    <li>Learn from those who came before; wisdom is invaluable, do not let it pass.</li>
                    <li>Do not hesitate; spontaneity is freedom.</li>
                    <li>Remind those you love that you do; they know, but remembrance is sweet.</li>
                    <li>Support even if you do not understand; allyship is love.</li>
                    <li>Do not discourse; needless argument is evil, you must choose to not engage</li>
                    <li>Respect diverse minds: your belief is not universal, such is beautiful.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The Life
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Cherish nature; it will outlive you, support it as it supports you.</li>
                    <li>Do not interfere; you are not God, do not cosplay His hand.</li>
                    <li>They are your neighbors; do not infringe.</li>
                    <li>Appreciate your companions; they love you more than you could imagine.</li>
                    <li>Visit the unknown; enrich yourself through nature and escape modernity often.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The Establishment
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Fight the systems that forsake you; demand equity, settle for no less.</li>
                    <li>Be the change you want; Do not rely on another to perform your duty.</li>
                    <li>Know your enemy’s enemy; while not the goal, the lesser of two evils is the next step.</li>
                    <li>Recognize your ancestors; they entrusted you with the battle they started.</li>
                    <li>To be rich is to be evil; obtaining and maintaining excess demand acts of evil or negligence.</li>
                    <li>Build up the oppressed; none deserve hell on earth because they want to live.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The World
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Leave all better than it was found. You were blessed with life, allow it to remain a blessing for those who will follow.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
